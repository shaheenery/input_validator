# Programming exercise

I'm terribly sorry that I wasn't able to create the solution during our live coding and phone call meeting today.

I have created the solution in Ruby as well as Elixir (with tests) for you to take a look.

## Notable Elixir files
```lib/validator.ex```
and
```test/validator_test.exs```
## Running the tests
```cd ruby && ruby validator_test.rb```
```cd elixir && mix test```
